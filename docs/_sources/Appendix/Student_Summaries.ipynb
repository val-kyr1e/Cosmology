    "# Student Participation (Spring 2023)\n",
    "Students will work in pairs to produce summaries of each class meeting.  These summaries should list the main topics discussed and emphasized ideas/examples during the respective lecture.  Students are encouraged to be as detailed as possible without being overly verbose.  The summaries should be submitted as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) from **your forked repository** before the next class meeting.\n"

    "### Intro to Cosmology I\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1 What is Cosmology?** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of our universe and other universes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Need to know knowledge of the universe because there is chaos in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1.1 How does the Universe work?** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Einstein-one of the most famous physicist in modern physics \n",
    "\n",
    "- To answer why the Sun is responsible, many cultures deify the Sun and create rituals (Whenever you see the Sun in the sky, you get warm) \n",
    "\n",
    "- There were some other stars that appeared to wander through the night sky, which they called the planets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The heliocentric description of how the Universe works would eventually overtake the geocentric view because of technological advancements that improved the observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1.2 Where did everything come from?** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Another purpose of cosmology is to explain the origin of everything. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ancient cultures developed their stories using observations in their daily lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Galaxies form through clusters of stars interacting with a special substance called dark matter, but the details of the dark matter are still being determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Larger structures form clusters of galaxies that all originated from an immense expansion of the Universe from a big bang event. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1.3 How does the origin story explain the current structure?** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Around 100 years ago, the Universe consisted of only the Milky Way, and it was static (neither expanding nor contracting). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Universe was much larger than assumed and it was expanding. This meant that the Universe could have a beginning and thus, an origin story was not completely a human invention. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A changing Universe means that we can map effects to potential causes using observations of the faintest galaxies. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Dark matter affects the formation and rotation of galaxies. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Dark energy makes up around 70% of everything \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2 Cosmology among many cultures**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2.1 Ancient Egypt**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Early Egyptian culture developed a cosmology during the 2nd and 3rd millennia B.C.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key to the rediscovery of ancient Egyptian culture was with the Rosetta Stone, which was a monument made of stone or wooden slab\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pharaohs (i.e., Egyptian kings) used some of the Egyptian gods (e.g., Osiris, Isis, Ptah, horus and Anubis) to establish their right to rule. From there, the monuments of Egypt were built, which included the pyramids and temples. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Osiris controlled fertility, agriculture, and the afterlife representing the forces of order, while Isis represented motherhood and is the sister-wife of Osiris. The brother of Osiris was Set, who controlled the deserts, violence, and foreigners representing the forces of chaos, with his sister-wife Nephthys who is associated with mourning, night, childbirth, and service to the temple."
